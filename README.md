# Landing_page
This project is a project from the curriculum of Udacity's Nanodegree Program.

# Languages_used
The skeleton code was provided for the webpage with HTMl and CSS, the project required mainy javascript codes to make the website more dynamic.

# How_i_created_it
Javascript was used to create functions which check the number of section and their ID's and based on them, the navigation bar values are appended. The second function is to create active states class in each sections when scrolled, based on the a specific height from the viewport. This active-state is given styles using CSS. The last function is to smoothly scroll over to the section when clicked in the navigation bar.

# What_i_learned
I learned to use javascript to add the navigation bar based on the number of sections dynamically and also to add attributes to elements and more.
